Profile
======
I am a molecular ecologist with broad interests in statistics, genetics and behaviour. My primary research centres on the role of microbes in determining human and animal health, including how animal microbiomes provide protection from disease, or optimise host nutrition. More recently I have become interested in the threats posed by antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and how human and animal microbiomes may prevent, or promote, the spread of microbes resistant to antibiotics.
