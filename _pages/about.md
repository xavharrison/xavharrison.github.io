I lead a group of researchers broadly interested in how microbes shape the health of animal hosts. A large focus of our work is on the interaction between host microbiomes and pathogens in wildlife, using amphibians and mammals as model systems. I am also interested in the forces that shape variation among individuals in their microbiome dynamics, and how this variation may influence behaviour, body condition, and response to infection. 

As a science hobby / side hustle, I use simulation-based approaches to test how best to apply statistical tools like GLMMs to complex ecological data. 

For more information, see the [Projects](projects.md) and [People](people.md) pages, and Group News below! Recent papers can be found [here](papers.md)

If you'd like to join the lab, please get in touch via email.

Group News 
======
- Xav and Kirsty have a new preprint on [the drivers of microbiome dynamics in conservation translocations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.06.668623v1.abstract), now availalbe as a Preprint. This is a long term collaboration with [Rob Puschendorf](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/robert-puschendorf) at the University of Plymouth, working on endangered frogs in Costa Rica

- Xav has won a NERC Pushing the Frontiers grant with Mike Cant (Exeter) and Hazel Nichols (Swansea) to work on the role of the microbiome in determining scent and group identities in Banded Mongooses. Postdoctoral positions coming in 2026!

- Dr Anna Bowland passed her PhD viva with no corrections. Her thesis looks at the ingestion of fermented fruits in Chimpanzees, and individual dynamics 
of the chimp gut microbiome. Congrats Anna!

- BBSRC PhD Student Tasha Meadows submitted her first first-author paper on the factor shaping the faecal microbiomes of European badgers, now available as a [Preprint](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/dashboard/9441/). 

- Dr Angie Hayward has won a Leverhulme Fellowship to work on the link between gut microbiome and pesticide resistance in bees, and will be joining the lab later in the year.
