I lead a group of researchers broadly interested in how microbes shape the health of animal hosts. This includes understanding how the skin microbiome of amphibians can protect them from disease, and how the diet we feed our dogs shapes their health. 

As a science hobby, I like to look at how best to apply statistical tools like GLMMs to complex ecological data. 

For more information, see the [Projects](projects.md) and [People](people.md) pages, and Group News below! Recent papers can be found [here](papers.md)

- Dr Anna Bowland passed her PhD viva with no corrections. Her thesis looks at the ingestion of fermented fruits in Chimpanzees, and individual dynamics 
of the chimp gut microbiome. Congrats Anna!

- BBSRC PhD Student Tasha Meadows submitted her first first-author paper on the factor shaping the faecal microbiomes of European badgers, now available as a [Preprint](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/dashboard/9441/).
