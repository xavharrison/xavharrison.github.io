Tasha's PhD is part of a long term collaboration with the APHA, studying the dynamics of bovine tuberculosis infection within Woodchester Park. She is studying what shapes the bacterial microbiomes of European badgers, and the wider role of the environment as a conduit through which microbes and anti-microbial resistance (AMR) can spread.
